Every modern web framework has the concept of a component. Most require you to learn a non-standard dialect in order to use them though. Enhance enables you to write single file components with the same benefits of co-location and ease of reuse while leveraging the skills you already have.

Wouldn't it be nice if you could author components like HTML pages? Well that's what you get with enhance single file components. Let's say you want to make a reusable "hello world" component where the greeting can be changed.

## HTML

You would author your component as an HTML custom element.
```html
<hello-world greeting="Hello World"></hello-world>
```

## Template

The template function that defines what your custom element should expand to is passed an `html` function and a state object containing attributes.

```javascript
export default function HelloWorld({ html, state }) {
  const { attrs } = state
  const { greeting='Hello World' } = attrs
  return html`
<h1>${ greeting }</h1>
  `
}

```

## Style

Styles are added by inserting a standard `<style>` tag.
```javascript
export default function HelloWorld({ html, state }) {
  const { attrs } = state
  const { greeting='Hello World' } = attrs
  return html`
<style>
  hello-world h1 {
    color: red;
  }
</style>
<h1>${ greeting }</h1>
  `
}

```

Any valid css will work, and any style prefixed with your chosen custom element name will be scoped to only that type of element.

## Script

What we have so far works great for initial render, but what if you want to add additional `<hello-world>` elements dynamically while your app is being used.
You will need some JavaScript for that. Add a `<script>` tag to your component.

```html
<!-- ...continued -->
<script type="module">
  // Custom element class definition
  class HelloWorld extends HTMLElement {
    constructor () {
      super()
      // Template will be added by enhance with an id ${your-element}-template
      const template = document.getElementById('hello-world-template')
      // When your custom element is inserted the template contents will be expanded
      this.replaceChildren(template.content.cloneNode(true))
      // You can write queries that are scoped to the internals of your custom element
      this.heading = this.querySelector('h1')
    }

    static get observedAttributes () {
      // Return an Array of attributes your custom element needs to update
      return ['greeting']
    }

    attributeChangedCallback (name, oldValue, newValue) {
      if (name === 'greeting') {
        // Use the appropriate DOM manipulation function to only update what's necessary
        this.heading.textContent = newValue
      }
    }

    // Lifecycle hooks!
    connectedCallback () {
      console.log('Why hello there ðŸ‘‹')
    }
  }
  // Define your custom element tag name and base class
  customElements.define('hello-world', HelloWorld)
</script>
```

You get to author components as individual HTML pages with web standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript while enhance delivers a progressively enhanced experience to your users.
