title: Utility classes
---

Utility classes are an optimal way to apply general styling. They remove large amounts of duplication from your stylesheets and lend visual harmony to your app.

## Styleguide

As a basis of styleguides utility classes are unparalleled in providing a usable system for developers and a cohesive appearance to your users.

## Ready to go

Enhance comes preconfigured with a [customizable utility class system](https://github.com/enhance-dev/enhance-styles). During development you can use the stylesheet found in `public/styles.css`. For production you can inline this stylesheet into the head of your document since utility class stylesheets tend to be tiny — around ~30k on disk and 9k over the wire.

## Usage

Apply utility classes to your element markup

```javascript
export default function MyParagraph({ html }) {
  return html`
    <p class="font-serif p1 mb-1">
      <slot></slot>
    </p>
  `
}
```

## Customize

It is possible to completely customize your project's utility classes. To do so you will need to do two things:
- Add a `styleguide.json` file to the root of your project
  - [ 📄 You can copy this one to get started →](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enhance-dev/enhance-styles/main/config.json)
- Edit your project's `.arc` file to tell it where to grab the config

Add these lines at the bottom of your `.arc` file in the root of your project.

```arc
@enhance-styles
config styleguide.json
```
