        Architect provides everything you need to build massively scalable Functional Web Apps on AWS with low code, clear and terse config, and zero ceremony. While the Architect docs are built as a vanilla Architect app, we used Enhance to build out Architect’s landing page in order to leverage server rendered custom elements and scoped, reusable, and functional styling.
