        Enhance Music is a music library and audio player app built with HTML and CSS, and progressively enhanced with a couple pinches of JavaScript.

      <showcase-project title="Air Quality Index" image="/_public/img/showcase/aqi.jpg" url="https://invent-k6b.begin.app/">
        With wildfire season well upon us in North America, it’s a good idea to keep an eye on local air quality. Let’s get some real time data from the US EPA’s AirNow program. Even with a limited API request budget, we can get snappy results by caching and refreshing data on demand. All with features already built into Enhance.
