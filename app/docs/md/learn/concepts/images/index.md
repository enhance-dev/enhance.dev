Images are an important consideration in web design and development. Responsive images offer major performance improvements by delivering appropriately sized images to a range of device resolutions and viewport sizes — so that, for example, a mobile phone doesn't waste time and bandwidth downloading an image sized for a widescreen monitor.

Implementing responsive images, however, can be tough to get right. Preparing multiple variants of images can be tedious and time consuming. Additionally, the web platform APIs for using responsive images in the browser can be hard to wrap your head around, making high performance scores and great user experiences a challenge to achieve.

This is where Enhance Image comes in. By combining a simple custom element interface with an on-demand image transformer, it saves time on image preparation and reduces the overhead of implementing responsive images correctly.
