The Enhance starter project is set-up to enable you to create dynamic multi-page applications with as little friction as possible. It comes preconfigured with everything you need to work with file based routing and standards based components.

```
app
â”œâ”€â”€ api ............... data routes
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ elements .......... custom element pure functions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ my-header.mjs
â””â”€â”€ pages ............. file based routing
    â””â”€â”€ index.html
```

## Pages
The pages folder enables file based routing. To add a route just add an HTML file. The name of the file will be the URL you view it at. Meaning `app/pages/about.html` will be viewed at `/about`.

## Elements
The elements folder is where you keep your [single file components](/docs/learn/concepts/single-file-components). These are custom element templates that get rendered server side and set-up your HTML page for progressive enhancement.

Elements must be [named](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#prod-potentialcustomelementname) with one or more words separated by a dash `my-header.mjs` which corresponds to the tag name you author in your html pages `<my-header></my-header>`.

## API

The `api` folder is preconfigured to expose data to your file based routes. Meaning the file `app/api/index.mjs` will automatically pass state to `app/pages/index.mjs` as well as expose an endpoint for standard REST verbs like `get` and `post`
