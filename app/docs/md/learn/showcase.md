We regularly build new example applications to demonstrate what's possible with Enhance (spoiler: the sky's the limit). Along with our own example applications, you'll also find real world applications here, built by users of Enhance.

<doc-showcase title="Air Quality Index" image="/_public/img/showcase/aqi.jpg" url="https://invent-k6b.begin.app/">
With wildfire season well upon us in North America, it’s a good idea to keep an eye on local air quality. Let’s get some real time data from the US EPA’s AirNow program. Even with a limited API request budget, we can get snappy results by caching and refreshing data on demand. All with features already built into Enhance.
