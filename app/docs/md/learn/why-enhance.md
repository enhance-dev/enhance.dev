title: Why Enhance?
---

Our mission is to enable anyone to build multi-page dynamic web apps while staying as close to the platform as possible. Enhance fills in the gaps to make building for the backend, and the browser a seamless experience for web authors and consumers.

Modern JavaScript frameworks bring more problems than they solve; recreating native web platform features adding unnecessary weight and complexity, which is challenging to unravel.

Enhance provides a dependable foundation built on standards-based web platform features, allowing developers to create web applications that are lightweight, flexible, and future-proof.

Our criteria for success are:

1. Author and deliver HTML pages

<doc-callout mark="🖋️" level="none" thin>

**Enhance** should allow developers to write components as pure functions that return HTML. Then render them on the server to deliver complete HTML immediately available to the end user.

2. Use Web Standards

<doc-callout mark="🧾" level="none" thin>

**Enhance** should take care of the tedious parts, allowing you to use today's Web Platform standards more efficiently. As new standards and platform features become generally available, Enhance will make way for them.

3. Progressively enhance working HTML

**Enhance** should allow for easy progressive enhancement so that working HTML can be further developed to add additional functionality with JavaScript.

Now we spend more time adding new features and less time chasing breaking changes from dependencies. Your app can scale without ever-increasing build times and JavaScript payloads.

With direct access to all available browser APIs (like forms, validation, and style encapsulation), there is no need to cobble together libraries and polyfills to develop a complex application.
Skeleton screens and spinners be gone. Flashes of unstyled content (FOUC) or layout shifts from delayed JavaScript don't belong anymore.

Using just HTML, CSS, and a sprinkling of JavaScript, Enhance can build complex dynamic applications in harmony with the Web Platform, allowing developers to spend their time on interesting domain problems leading to more engaging products with less thrash.
