## The Request Journey

This one is too wide for the doc content column.

## Your Application

Let's zoom in on the most important part of the project: the code you write for your application.

### 2-column doc

<div class="ml1" style="float:right">

![Enhance - "Your Application" detail](img/charts/enhance-chart-your-app.png)

</div>

A narrow column view.

Explanatory content can be aligned left.

<hr class="block mt3 mb3 border1" style="clear:both" />

### Wide "popout" view

This is the same chart content with a "popout" view.

## The Browser

Finally, we'll look at the code executed in the connected browser with an aim to progressively enhance our server-rendered application.

### 2-column doc

<div class="mr1" style="float:left">

![Enhance - "Browser" detail](img/charts/enhance-chart-browser.png)

</div>

A narrow column view.

It's also possible to write content to the right of the narrow images.

<hr class="block mt3 mb3 border1" style="clear:both" />

### Wide "popout" view

This is the same chart content with a "popout" view.

## Note

This layout is likely terrible on small/mobile screens.

The images have a grey background and do not look good in dark mode.
