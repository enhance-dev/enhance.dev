title: Cribsheet
---

Every Enhance app ships with a preconfigured, dynamic cribsheet to help you find the right Enhance Styles class for the job.

Just start your project (`npm start`) and navigate to `/_styleguide/cribsheet`. Here you'll be able to search through all the utility classes and custom properties available to your app. Any [customizations](/docs/enhance-styles/customization) you make to your styleguide will automatically be reflected in your cribsheet.
