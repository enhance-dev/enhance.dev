When building applications with Enhance, we start with working HTML and then look for ways to progressively enhance the user's enjoyment by using JavaScript. We are not "never JavaScripters," but we are well aware of the cost in performance and loss of sales that [excessive JavaScript](https://thenewstack.io/too-much-javascript-why-the-frontend-needs-to-build-better/) leads to. With that in mind, we build our apps HTML first to ensure even the oldest of devices are supported and then look to improve user experience with judicious usage of JavaScript.

## API Routes

For this blog post, I will build an app that uses the Dog API to fetch (pun intended) a random picture of a dog based on the breed that you select.  Communication with the Dog API will happen on our server so we can send valid HTML down to the browser without using client-side JavaScript.

Our API route `app/api/index.mjs` makes two API calls to the Dog API to get a list of all the breeds and a random picture of a dog from that breed. Then the data we collect is returned to our HTML pages, where our custom elements can access it via their `store` property.

<begin-code filename="app/api/index.mjs">

```javascript

export async function get (req) {
  const { breed = 'shiba' } = req.query
  const response = await getJSON('/breeds/list/all')
  const breeds = Object.keys(response?.message || {})
  const dog = (await getJSON(`/breed/${breed}/images/random`)).message
  return {
    json: { breed, breeds, dog }
  }
}

```

<begin-code>

<deploy-docs-callout level="info">

I've omitted the `getJSON` method from the code sample above as it is just a fetching JSON.

</deploy-docs-callout>

**Note:** I‚Äôm not advocating for any particular dog breed or crypto coin with my default of shiba. I just like the look of those dogs.

## Structuring our HTML

When building apps with web components, we compose our application out of smaller single-responsibility components. It leads to some extremely readable HTML.

<begin-code filename="app/pages/index.html">

```html

<dog-container class="block mi-auto">
  <dog-header></dog-header>
  <dog-main>
    <dog-form>
      <dog-breed-select></dog-breed-select>
      <dog-submit-button></dog-submit-button>
    </dog-form>
    <dog-image></dog-image>
  </dog-main>
</dog-container>

```

</begin-code>

Just look at that mark-up üë©‚Äçüç≥üíã, it‚Äôs so easy to understand what is happening at every level without having to dig into the code to figure out what‚Äôs going on.

## Form Components

Let‚Äôs focus on our form component, which includes a select and button element. Visually it looks like this:

<blog-image src='/_public/blog/post-assets/random-doggo/html-only.png' alt='HTML Only'></blog-image>

To get a new random dog photo, the user would choose the breed from the select element and then click the fetch button to make the request.

Let‚Äôs take a look at those components, starting with our `dog-form`.

<begin-code filename="app/elements/dog-form.mjs">

```javascript

export default function DogForm({ html }) {
  return html`
    <form class="mb-3 text-center">
      <slot></slot>
    </form>
  `
}

```

</begin-code>

Our form element is simplicity itself. We don‚Äôt even need to waste bytes by providing the `method` and `action` attributes, as we can rely on the defaults `GET` and the current URL, respectively. Any child elements passed into `dog-form` will be slotted into the `slot` tag.

In our case, these are the `dog-breed-select` and `dog-submit-button` components.

<begin-code filename="app/elements/dog-breed-select.mjs">

```javascript

export default function DogBreedSelect ({ html, state }) {
  const { store } = state
  const { breed, breeds } = store
  const options = breeds.map(
    breedname => `<option ${breed === breedname ? "selected" : ""}
    value="${breedname}">${breedname}</option>`
  ).join('')

  return html`
    <style>
      select {
        border: 2px solid var(--dark);
      }

      select:focus {
        outline-offset: 4px;
      }
    </style>
    <label for="breed" class="pie-5">Choose a dog breed:</label>
    <select id="breed" name="breed" class="mie-1 radius1 pi-2 pb-4">
        ${options}
    </select>
  `
}

```

</begin-code>

We are just returning a select element whose options are generated from the list of breeds we queried earlier in our API layer.

<begin-code filename="app/elements/dog-submit-button.mjs">

```javascript

export default function DogSubmitButton({ html }) {
  return html`
    <style>
      button {
        border-color: var(--dark);
      }

      button:focus {
        outline-offset: 4px;
      }
    </style>
      <button class="font-medium background-transparent radius1 border-solid border2 pb-4 pi-2">
        <span class="si-100 flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
            Fetch
            <span style="margin-left: 8px; display: inherit;">
                <svg></svg>
            </span>
        </span>
    </button>
`
}

```

</begin-code>

Our submit button is nothing special, mostly just styling our DOM elements using Enhance Styles. Note: I‚Äôve omitted the `svg` code for the sake of brevity.

When combined together, our app performs like this:

## Enhanced Form Component

While we have a perfectly functional application, one thing bothers me, and that is the select/button combo component. I would like to fetch a new dog photo each time the user changes the breed selection without clicking the Fetch button. That‚Äôs where some client-side JavaScript comes into play.

We will update our `dog-form` component to include a `script` tag where we will define a custom element using standard web component APIs. Our updated `dog-form` component looks like this:

<begin-code filename="app/elements/dog-form.mjs">

```javascript

export default function DogForm({ html }) {
  return html`
    <form class="mb-3 text-center">
        <slot></slot>
    </form>
    <script type="module">
      class DogForm extends HTMLElement {
        constructor() {
          super()
          this.form = this.querySelector('form')
          this.select = this.querySelector('select')
          this.submit = this.querySelector('button')
          this.onChange = this.onChange.bind(this)
        }
        connectedCallback() {
          if (this.select && this.submit) {
            this.submit.classList.remove('inline-flex')
            this.submit.classList.add('hidden')
            this.select.addEventListener('change', this.onChange)
          }
        }
        disconnectedCallback() {
          this.select.removeEventListener('change', this.onChange)
        }
        onChange() {
          this.form.submit()
        }
      }

      customElements.define('dog-form', DogForm)
    </script>
  `
}

```

</begin-code>

In our `script` tag, we:

- Define a new class called `DogForm` which extends `HTMLElement`.
- Create a `constructor` method to create references to our form, select and button elements.
- In our `connectedCallback` method we add an on change listener to the select element and hide the button as it is no longer required.
- Our `disconnectedCallback` cleans up our on change listener so we don‚Äôt have a memory leak.
- The `onChange` method submits the form for us to fetch a new random dog picture.

Now we have an application that works without client-side JavaScript but also progressively enhances itself to provide a better user experience when JavaScript is available.

## Conclusion

While this isn‚Äôt a very advanced example of progressive enhancement, it provides you with a template for approaching PE in your own application. Make things work first using just HTML and CSS, and then see how you can improve the user experience with a sprinkling of JavaScript.

One thing I like to do in my application is to build all the API interactions by using the `form` element to POST to our backend APIs. Then I enhance the form to use the `fetch` API and update my DOM with the returned data without requiring a page load.
